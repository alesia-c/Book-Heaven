# Book-Heaven
JavaFX Project I made for my Java class in my second year of studies. 
JavaFX Project I made for my Java class in my second year of studies. It mimics an e-commerce site that allows users to browse through the store's available books, to buy them etc.
Because I made this project in my second year of studies, it might not use the best programming and security principles, but I am proud of what i achieved.
